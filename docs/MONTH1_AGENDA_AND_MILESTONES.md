## 1. Project Track & Context Overview

`gittuf` provides a security layer for Git repositories, bringing cryptographic verification, authorization policies, and access controls grounded in The Update Framework (TUF) and in-toto attestations directly to Git workflows.

As the broader Git ecosystem transitions from SHA-1 to SHA-256 object formatting to defend against collision attacks (e.g., SHAttered, SHA-1 DC), security-critical tooling built on top of Git must support cryptographic hash agility without compromising existing signature chains.

This OJT milestone focuses on **GAP-1 (Gittuf Augmentation Proposal 1): Hash Agility (Issue #104)**: researching, auditing, prototyping, and empirically validating migration strategies for transitioning repositories and Gittuf cryptographic metadata from SHA-1 to SHA-256.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Evaluation Criteria

1. **Depth of Technical Understanding:** Demonstrated mastery of Git plumbing, TUF policy delegation, DSSE signatures, and SHA-256 compatibility.
2. **Empirical Rigor:** Concrete experimental validation of competing architectural hypotheses rather than theoretical conjecture.
3. **Actionable Upstream Contribution:** Deliverables directly aligned with community roadmap (gittuf/gittuf#104) ready for review by project maintainers (Paulo Gomes, Patrick Zielinski).
4. **Code Quality & Verification:** Production-grade Go idioms, zero regressions, and complete unit test coverage.
